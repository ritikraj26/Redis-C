# Redis Clone
In this project, we'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have `cmake` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `src/main.c`.
